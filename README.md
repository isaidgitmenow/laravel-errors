A powerful, elegant, and declarative error handling package for modern Laravel applications (Laravel 11+).

Built with **PHP 8.4+ Attributes** and strictly adhering to **SOLID principles**, this package replaces traditional, boilerplate-heavy exception rendering and reporting methods with clean, declarative attributes directly on your Exception classes.

## ✨ Features

- **Declarative PHP 8 Attributes**: Configure HTTP codes, reporting rules, rate limiting, and context directly on your exception classes.
- **Plug-and-Play Frontend Integrations**: Automatically detects the context of the request (**Filament, Livewire, Inertia, API, Web**) and formats the response appropriately so your SPA or Admin panel doesn't break on a 500 error.
- **Bulletproof Resilience**: Includes a self-healing `try/catch` wrapper so an error in your error handler never causes a White Screen of Death (WSOD).
- **Deep Attribute Inspection**: Safely traverses Laravel's wrapped exceptions (e.g., `QueryException`, `ViewException`) to find and apply your custom attributes on the original exception.
- **Spatie Ignition & Laravel Debugbar Ready**: Seamlessly integrates with local developer tools without breaking production flows.
- **Xdebug IDE Enrichment**: Push sanitized `#[WithContext]` payloads directly to your IDE as debug notifications.
- **Auto-Injection into Laravel Context**: Automatically forwards `#[WithContext]` data to downstream trackers like Sentry or Flare via Laravel 11's global `Context`.
- **Data Sanitization**: Built-in redaction for sensitive keys (like passwords and API tokens) before they hit logs or external trackers.
- **Anti-Spam Rate Limiting**: Prevent cascading failures from exhausting your error tracker quotas using the `#[RateLimit]` attribute.
- **Octane Compatible**: Automatically flushes the reflection cache and dynamic state after every request under Swoole / RoadRunner to prevent memory leaks.
- **Dynamic Pass-Through**: Third-party packages can register exceptions to bypass the pipeline at runtime — no config edits required.
- **Fallback Logging**: Ensures your application never runs completely blind by falling back to Laravel's default logger if no reporters are configured — whether via config or dynamically via `addReporter()`.
- **Environment-Specific Reporting**: Restrict `#[ReportTo]` to specific environments (e.g., only send Slack alerts in `production`).
- **`make:error` Artisan Command**: Scaffold fully decorated exception classes in seconds with `php artisan make:error`.
- **Static Analysis Ready**: Ships with a `phpstan.neon.dist` pre-configured for [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan) level 5.
- **MCP Server Built-in**: Includes a native Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so your AI agent can create, inspect, and simulate errors straight from your IDE.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Includes a GitHub Actions workflow matrix covering PHP 8.4/8.5 × Laravel 11/12.

## 📦 Requirements

- PHP 8.4+
- Laravel 11.0+

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require isaidgitmenow/laravel-errors
```

Optionally, publish the configuration file to customize the pipeline:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-errors-config"
```

Integration is incredibly simple. Open your `bootstrap/app.php` and register the handler:

```php
// bootstrap/app.php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Isaidgitmenow\LaravelErrors\ErrorHandler;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    // ...
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        // Let the package orchestrate your entire error pipeline:
        ErrorHandler::handle($exceptions);
    })->create();
```

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration (MCP Server)

This package ships with a native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server, meaning your favorite AI coding assistant (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Antigravity) can connect directly to your local error pipeline. 

With the MCP integration enabled, your AI can:
- **Generate Exceptions:** Ask your AI to "Create a `PaymentFailed` error with a 402 status that reports to Slack", and it will use the MCP tool to generate the fully decorated file.
- **Inspect Pipeline:** The AI can query your active Detectors, Renderers, and Reporters.
- **Search Logs:** The AI can query your application's historical JSONL error logs directly to help you debug past errors.
- **Simulate Errors:** The AI can instantiate and run exceptions through the pipeline in a rolled-back transaction to verify how they behave.

### Setup

To connect your AI agent, add the following configuration to your client's `mcp_config.json` (or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "laravel-errors-mcp": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan errors:mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
*(If you are on Linux or macOS, simply use `bash` and `-c` instead of `cmd` and `/c`)*

## 🧪 Testing

The package includes a comprehensive test suite (built with Pest and Orchestra Testbench).

```bash
composer test
```

Run static analysis with Larastan:

```bash
composer phpstan
```
